# Fibula
A 2D game engine built for game developers. Fibula is built mainly with C++ and OpenGL,
 and makes heavy use of a few handful libraries such as [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML), [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html)
 and the [C++ Standard Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Standard_Library). With focus on developers,
 Fibula aims to provide a different experience when creating games, by keeping the focus on the code rather than
 tools or over-complicated engines such as Unity or Unreal.
